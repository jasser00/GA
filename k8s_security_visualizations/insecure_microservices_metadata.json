Some components are:\n- Namespace: default, backend\n- Http service\n- PostgreSQL database\n- Authorization service for secrets management\n- API server\n- API gateway\n- Plain SQL database\n- HTTP, API, and Plain SQL database are connected by HTTP clients.\n\nThe document also describes the risks associated with different components and communication patterns. For example, there's a risk of Privilege Escalation, Container Escape, and SQL Injection (CWE-504) with the PostgreSQL database.\n\nVulnerabilities like No TLS, No Network Policy, and No Authentication are also mentioned.\n\nThe document provides a detailed security analysis and mitigations for various vulnerabilities in Kubernetes Microservice Architecture.",
